# AEIporter
Tool for converting Abyss Engine images to Portable Network Graphics, AEi2PNG in short, and PNG2AEi.

Requiers Python 3... (you will be safe with 3.11)

Made possible by [AEPi](https://github.com/Trimatix/AEPi) and it's author Trimatix, by Python devs, by LLMS, by Bill Gates, by that cat I met on a street.
Special thanks to the God almighty.
