# AEIporter
Tool for converting Abyss Engine images to Portable Network Graphics, AEi2PNG in short, and PNG2AEi.

Requiers Python 3... (you will be safe with 3.11)

###What works:
- Converting single AEI <-> PNG of AEPi supported formats (automaticaly detected).
- Converting whole directories of these type images.
- Drag and drop.
- GUI.
- Text input or file browsing trouhg OS' browser.

###What I would like to work / am planning to implement:
- AEI arrays support (conversion and editing).
- Image preview.
- Regex filtering for multiple file conversion.
- cmd line support.
- something cool.

Made possible by [AEPi](https://github.com/Trimatix/AEPi) and it's author Trimatix, by Python devs, by LLMS, by Bill Gates, by that cat I met on a street.
Special thanks to the God almighty.
